<h1>How to live with purpose using goals and tasks!</h1>

<p>Do you like ever shuffling on in an endless grind of stuff to do, emails to answer and yet another new project? Neither do I. I want to live with purpose and values, rather than have an email inbox as a publicly-writable to do list, just because that is “just how it works”. And there’s a relatively simple way to bring more purpose into daily work: recurring checklists for review, plan and reflect.</p>

<p>If you’re anything like me, you use an application for tracking to do-lists. These are great for actionable tasks and getting things done. My favourite is <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" title="A title">Things</a>. I also use a journal for, among other things, reflection on personal development and life goals. <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com">David Allen</a> calls these the <em>runway actions</em> and <em>50,000ft horizon of focus</em>, respectively. To live more deliberately, align these two.</p>

<h2>Aligning horizons of focus</h2>

<p>What are practical steps to feed our purpose, values and goals into our day-to-day to do-list? Assuming clarity of purpose and values, this is how I do it:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Quarterly goals</strong>: every quarter, I review my purpose, value and life balance; from that I write one to three goals for the next three months.</li>
	<li><strong>Weekly review</strong>: every week, on Monday morning I do a weekly review to capture open loops, clean up my to do lists and set weekly goals.</li>
	<li><strong>Daily check-in</strong>: every morning I review my tasks for the day and set one to three daily goals.</li>
	<li><strong>Daily check-out</strong>: every afternoon before I leave work, I review my progress and migrate any open tasks to the next day. As they say, tomorrow begins today.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Increasing the odds of success</h2>

<p>None of these steps are particularly hard to do, but they consume creative energy. Between cute cat pictures on the internet and unread messages in your inbox, <sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In order to do what’s right instead of what is convenient, we need all the help we can get. Here’s how I use Things to support this process:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>I have set up recurring tasks for all these events. This ensures they’re just another thing to do on any given day.

		<ol>
			<li>Sub item 1

				<ul>
					<li>foo</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Sub item 2</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>These recurring tasks have reminders set for the start or end of the day, so I am reminded about them when I come into work or am about to leave.</li>
	<li>The tasks contain checklists to make it remove as much friction as possible.</li>
	<li>I use tags to track particularly simple, low-energy tasks and bigger, focus-required tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The routine</h2>

<p>On Monday <mark>morning</mark> I am  to do a <code>weekly</code> review. I follow the check list to capture open loops, groom my to do-list and set weekly goals based on my quarterly goals and last week’s progress.</p>

<hr />

<pre><code class="code-highlighted code-elixir"><span class="syntax-all syntax-entity">Every</span> other morning of the week, <span class="syntax-all syntax-entity">I</span> am reminded to plan my day by picking one to three major tasks to complete <span class="syntax-all syntax-keyword">and</span> some minor, low<span class="syntax-all syntax-keyword">-</span>energy stuff. <span class="syntax-all syntax-entity">Every</span> afternoon before <span class="syntax-all syntax-entity">I</span> leave the office, <span class="syntax-all syntax-entity">I</span> am triggered to reflect on my progress <span class="syntax-all syntax-keyword">and</span> prepare <span class="syntax-all syntax-keyword">for</span> tomorrow.</code></pre>

<p>Every quarter, I’m reminded to review last quarter’s results and come up with new goals for the upcoming quarter. My journal contains my purpose and values and a bunch of personal trackers, making it easy to think about the upcoming months in terms of what I want to do, rather than what the world has put on my plate.</p>

<h2>Use tools and events to live purposefully</h2>

<p>I use Things to set recurring tasks with reminders and checklists to support a process of regular reflection and planning with my journal based on daily, weekly and quarterly goals. I’ve been using this system for a while now and it has given me a real sense of agency and tranquility. Give it a try and see what works for you.</p>
